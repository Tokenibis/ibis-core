# Ibis-core

Welcome to the Ibis-core repo! Hopefully, you were directed here via our [website](https://www.tokenibis.com/). If not, please take some time to check it out and get a general idea for the goals of our project.

The Ibis-core repo contains all of the smart contracts necessary to run the system as well as migration and unit test files associated with the truffle framework. A qualitative overview of the contract logic is provided in our [wiki](https://github.com/Tokenibis/ibis-core/wiki) section.

## status

Presently, the overall design of the contracts is (hopefully) more or less complete. We have completed light automated unit tests to walk through trivial normal-case expected functionality. The next steps are to verify wallet integration on the rospen followed by more rigorous security-focused unit testing.

Please feel free to poke around and verify that we can't steal your money. As always, suggestions and other offers of free labor are always appreciated.
